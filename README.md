# Teach Bittle Dog to Walk

> Original repo: https://github.com/ger01d/opencat-gym

A gym reinforcement learning environment for Quadruped robot based on Stable-Baselines3 and PyBullet.

## Simulation and Application

## Installation and Usage
Install python packages:
``` python
!pip install "stable-baselines3[extra]"
!pip install pybullet
```

Start training with 
``` 
python train.py 
```
To take a look at the pre-trained example, execute 
``` 
python enjoy.py
```
Alternatively you can run [`opencat-gym.ipyn`](https://github.com/ger01d/opencat-gym/blob/main/opencat-gym.ipynb) in Jupyter notebook and perform training.

### Playing with training parameters
The training parameters are listed as constants in the `opencat-gym-env.py`. They change the weight of the reward-function.
``` python
PENALTY_STEPS = 2e6       # Increase of penalty by step_counter/PENALTY_STEPS
FAC_MOVEMENT = 1000.0     # Reward movement in x-direction
FAC_STABILITY = 0.1       # Punish body roll and pitch velocities
FAC_Z_VELOCITY = 0.0      # Punish z movement of body
FAC_SLIP = 0.0            # Punish slipping of paws
FAC_ARM_CONTACT = 0.01    # Punish crawling on arms and elbows
FAC_SMOOTH_1 = 1.0        # Punish jitter and vibrational movement, 1st order
FAC_SMOOTH_2 = 1.0        # Punish jitter and vibrational movement, 2nd order
FAC_CLEARANCE = 0.0       # Factor to enfore foot clearance to PAW_Z_TARGET
PAW_Z_TARGET = 0.005      # Target height (m) of paw during swing phase
```
